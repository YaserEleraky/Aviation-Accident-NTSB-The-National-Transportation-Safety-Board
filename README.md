# Accident-The-National-Transportation-Safety-Board-NTSB
I analyzed accident data for the NTSB, resolving missing values and data issues using programming skills. I filled gaps with FAA and other reliable sources, then applied advanced feature engineering and visualization for insightful results.


The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) is an independent federal agency in the United States dedicated to investigating transportation accidents, including aviation accidents. Here's a brief description of NTSB's role and responsibilities in aviation accident investigation:

- **Investigation Mandate:** The NTSB is responsible for investigating civil aviation accidents and incidents in the United States and its territories. It also investigates significant accidents involving U.S.-registered aircraft worldwide.
  
- **Objective:** The primary objective of NTSB investigations is to determine the probable cause(s) of accidents and incidents, with the goal of enhancing transportation safety and preventing future accidents.
  
- **Investigation Process:** When an aviation accident occurs, the NTSB dispatches a team of investigators to the accident site. These investigators collect evidence, interview witnesses, analyze data, and reconstruct the sequence of events leading to the accident.
  
- **Probable Cause Determination:** After completing its investigation, the NTSB issues a final report that includes its findings and conclusions regarding the probable cause(s) of the accident. The report may also contain safety recommendations aimed at preventing similar accidents in the future.
  
- **Safety Recommendations:** In addition to determining probable causes, the NTSB issues safety recommendations to address systemic safety issues identified during investigations. These recommendations may target regulatory agencies, industry stakeholders, or other relevant parties.
  
- **Advocacy and Outreach:** The NTSB advocates for safety improvements in various transportation modes, including aviation. It conducts outreach activities, disseminates safety information, and promotes awareness of transportation safety issues among stakeholders and the public.
